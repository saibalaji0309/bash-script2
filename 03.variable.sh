# !/bin/bash

# what is variable? 
# it's generally use to hold the dybamical values

a=10
b=33
x=afsd

# in bash ther is no data types 

echo a
echo $a
echo "print the value of a $a"

# did find the difference b/w above two satatements 
# 1--> give : a
# 2--> give value of a : 10

# q)  when to try to print the value that does not defined before what will happen?
echo "print the value of mama: $mama"

# this is the main draw-back where the variable is not declered but it giving as null value
